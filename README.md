Evaluation:
Clearly shows the advantages of predictive maintenance and system efficiency improvements.

## 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
Definition: Requests responses from a specific role or viewpoint.

Prompt:
As a plant manager, describe the benefits of IoT-based monitoring in your factory.

Output:
From a manager’s perspective, IoT-based monitoring allows real-time insights into machine performance, reduces unexpected downtime, improves worker safety, and optimizes energy consumption. The system enables proactive decision-making and better resource allocation.

Evaluation:
Provides role-specific insights and practical benefits of the technology.

## 3. Everyday Functioning Prompts
Definition: Explains how the system works in daily operations.

Prompt:
Describe how IoT devices monitor machinery performance in day-to-day manufacturing operations.

Output:
IoT sensors collect data from machines continuously, track performance metrics, detect anomalies, and send alerts to maintenance teams. Predictive analytics ensures maintenance is scheduled before failures, ensuring smooth operations.

Evaluation:
Demonstrates real-world application and operational benefits.

## 4. Universal Prompt Structures (Prompt Refinements)
Definition: Uses standardized templates to explain concepts clearly.

Examples:

Prompt: Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example.
Output:
Predictive maintenance uses sensor data to predict machine failures before they happen. For example, a vibration sensor detects irregular machine movement and triggers maintenance before a breakdown occurs.

Prompt: Explain the process of IoT-based monitoring step by step.
Output:
  1.Install IoT sensors on machines
  2.Collect real-time performance data
  3.Analyze data using AI algorithms
  4.Generate predictive alerts
  5.Schedule maintenance6.Record and optimize operations

Evaluation:
Provides structured, step-by-step, easy-to-understand explanations.

## 5. Prompt Size Limitations
Definition: Manage large or complex prompts by dividing them into smaller tasks.

Examples:

Large Prompt: Explain all benefits and applications of IoT in manufacturing.
Refined Prompt: Explain five benefits at a time.

Large Prompt: List 50 IoT use cases in manufacturing.
Refined Prompt: List 10 use cases at a time.

Evaluation:
Prevents information overload and improves clarity and response quality.
